class myspbc(pbc.SPBCProcess):
    """
    This is an example SPBC implementation demonstrating how to access and use
    the data available through XBOS.

    Configuration:
    - namespace: do not change
    - wavemq: address of local wavemq agent
    - name: name of the SPBC controller. Naming each SPBC allows us to have multiple
      parallel SPBCs in operation. LPBCs choose which SPBC they want to listen to by
      specifying this name in their own configuration.
    - entity: the name of the local file constituting the 'identity' of this process.
      The entity file is what gives this process the permission to interact with other
      resources
    - reference_channels: a list of URIs representing the phasor channels the SPBC
      subscribes to as reference phasors


    Data: the SPBC has several data streams available to it as a result of its configuration.
    - self.reference_phasors: contains the most recently received phasors from each of the reference
      phasor channels. This only contains the data from the most recently received phasor message,
      which *does not* consist of all the data since the SPBC "compute_and_announce" was last run
      The SPBC framework keeps the self.reference_phasors data up to date in the background.

      self.reference_phasors is a dictionary keyed by the names of the phasor channels indicated
      in the 'reference_channels' configuration option. For example, if the SPBC is configured
      with "reference_channels = ['flexlab1/L1','flexlab1/L2']", then self.reference_phasors would
      contain the following structure:

        self.reference_phasors = {
            'flexlab1/L1': [
                {
                    "time": "1559231114799996800",
                    "angle": 193.30149788923268,
                    "magnitude": 0.038565948605537415
                },
                {
                    "time": "1559231114899996400",
                    "angle": 195.50249902851263,
                    "magnitude": 0.042079225182533264
                }
                ... etc
            ],
            'flexlab/L2': [
                {
                    "time": "1559231114799996800",
                    "angle": 220.30149788923268,
                    "magnitude": 10.038565948605537415
                },
                {
                    "time": "1559231114899996400",

                }
            ]
        }
    - self.lpbcs: contains the most recent LPBC statuses. By default, the SPBC subscribes to
      all LPBC instances it has permission to access. The SPBC framework subscribes to the
      LPBC statuses in the background and transparently updates the self.lpbcs structure.
      self.lpbcs is a dictionary keyed by the names of each LPBC:

        self.lpbcs = {
            'lpbc_1': {
                # local time of LPBC
